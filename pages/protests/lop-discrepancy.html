      <p>Accordingly this letter of protest is lodged in lieu of endorsing the Bill of Lading with the ship's figures and the Bill of Lading must be taken only to acknowledge the shipment of the weight or quantity given in the vessel's measurements on completion of loading, and to have been issued  without prejudice to the right of the owners or Charterers to relay on the ship's measurements aforesaid as the evidence of the quantity actually shipped.</p>
      <p>I hereby give you notice that you will be hold liable to indemnify the Owners or Charterers or both  to any loss they may suffer by reason of your failure to notify the transferee and subsequent holder  of the Bill of Lading of the contents of this letter of protest.</p>
      <p>On behalf of the Owners and Charterers I further reserve the right to take such further action as  may be necessary to protect the interest of these parties.</p>
